#+TITLE: DDS converter

* Introduction
  This is a tool for converting dds to png and vice versa.
  I initially made this for UI modification but this fits other needs too.

  This script runs on linux.
  
* Dependencies:
  You *DO NEED TO INSTALL* the following packages:

  =imagemagic=

* Usage:
  1. Create *dds* and *png* dirs in same place.
  2. Add the files you want to convert inside the input folder.
  3. Give the script permission to execute =chmod+x *.sh= and place it outside input folder.
  4. Run the script =./ddsconverters.sh=

* Example usage:
- If I want to convert dds to png:
  1. Create *dds* and *png* dirs inside my /home/user/ dir.
  2. Paste my dds files inside dds folder.
  3. Paste my ddsconverters.sh in my //home/user/ dir.
  4. In my terminal: =chmod +x ddsconverters.sh=
  5. =./ddsconverters.sh=
  6. Press *1* and *Enter* (to select [1] - DDS to PNG)
  7. Wait for conversion, my converted files will be located in /home/user/png/ dir.
